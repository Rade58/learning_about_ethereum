`ACCOUNT ADDRESS` (THINK OF IT LIKE AN EMAIL ADDRESS OR USERNAME (**IT TELLS WHO YOU ARE**)) (YOU CAN SHARE THIS KEY) (**THIS CAY IS SHOWN ON METAMASK ANDER Account AND IT HAS COPY BUTTON SO YOU CAN COPY HIM**) 

THESE TWO NEXT KEYS COMBINED FORM A PSSWORD SOME SORTS (**THESE KEYS AUTHORIZE SENDING OF FUNDS FOR YOUR TO OTHER ACCOUNTS**)

`PUBLIC KEY`

`PRIVATE KEY`

**IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PRIVATE KEY YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SEND FUNDS TO SOMEONE ELSE**
